Projects built while following this Udemy SwiftUI Masterclass (https://www.udemy.com/course/swiftui-masterclass-course-ios-development-with-swift/) to explore:
- UI layout and SwiftUI design patterns
- SwiftData integration
- Created list layouts
- Implemented image picker to let users select and save photos (e.g., pets)
- Built a movie watchlist app that saves titles along with their genres. Also allows to randomise the movies and pick one for the user to watch.
